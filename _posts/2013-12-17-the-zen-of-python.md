## The Zen of Python

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Python之禅

> 美比丑好
直言不讳比心照不宣好
简单比复杂好
复杂比难以理解好

平面的比嵌套的好
错落有致比密密匝匝的好
可读性很重要

虽然实用比纯粹更重要
但特殊情况不能特殊到打破规律
永远别让错误悄悄地溜走
除非是你故意的
碰到模棱两可的地方，绝对不要去作猜测
什么事情都应该有一个，而且最好只有一个显而易见的解决办法
虽然刚开始的时候，这个办法可能不是那么的显而易见，但谁叫你不是荷兰人
有些事情不理不睬可能会比过一会解决要好
但最好是现在就解决

如果一个想法实现起来很困难，那它本身就不是一个好想法
如果一个想法实现起来很容易，那它或许就是一个好想法
命名空间是一个很了不起的想法,让我们多多使用吧
